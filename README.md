# DSC210 Group 1 Fall '24
## Data Mining Project: Recommendation Systems
### From SVD to BPR and T4Rec 

Group 1:
Joel Polizzi, Antariksha Ray, Lora Khatib, Jemin Vagadia

Examining recommendation systems past and present. We begin with a historical introduction into basic rating systems utilizing Single Value Decomposition of a matrix to provide item ratings, to evaluating a modern linear approach of Bayesian Personalizating Ranking, and ending with a State-of-the-art approach leveraging Transformers for recommendation. 

The repo contains all our final project material including our Project Report Latex and PDF, our slides, and our jupyter notebook containing the coding portions of the project.

## Coding: Notebook Instructions
In order to run our notebook the following requirements must be met:
- Google Colab Account and access to a T4 GPU

We are leveraging Colab for two key resons. 
1) Ability to connect a github repository notebook
2) Free access with GPU availability. **NOTE**: GPU is free on Google Colab as ***availability permits***. You will need to have GPU access to run out notebook in a reasonable amount of time.

_ _This notebook was tested using the free T4 GPU Runtime in google colab. Though colab offers A100 and L4 cards under paid accounts however our project was not run under these environments. Please use the T4 GPU Runtime._ _

#### Step 1: Navigate to Colab
Navigate to google colab: [https://colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com)

#### Step 2: Open the github repository directly from Colab
When You navigate to Google Colab you will be prompted to open a notebook. On the left hand side there is a link to open from Github. You will need to enter in our github URL into the search field: https://github.com/joelpolizzi/DSC210-group_proj

#### Step 3: Select the Group_1_DataMining.ipynb
Select the Group_1_DataMining.ipynb notebook and the project will open
