### From SVD to BPR and T4Rec 

Group 1:
Joel Polizzi, Antariksha Ray, Lora Khatib, Jemin Vagadia

Examining recommendation systems past and present. We begin with a historical introduction into basic rating systems utilizing Single Value Decomposition of a matrix to provide item ratings, to evaluating a modern linear approach of Bayesian Personalizating Ranking, and ending with a State-of-the-art approach leveraging Transformers for recommendation. 

The repo contains all our final project material including our Project Report Latex and PDF, our slides, and our jupyter notebook containing the coding portions of the project.
