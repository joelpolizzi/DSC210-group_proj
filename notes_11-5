Matrix factorization

Look up the approaches on basic theory for what we will be doing with linear algebra.

Modern method:

Experimentations in linear algebra - coding it

Modern: look into api's and libraries to implement.
ensure we can import these libraries and externals into the notebook. 

dont have to show basic numpy ops.
